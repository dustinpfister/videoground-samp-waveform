# waver

What I want to do with this project is have a way to log out sample data from a wav file in a number of formats. The first and formost reason I want to do this is to just have a basic tool for creating 1-bit sample depth data from 8, 16, and 24 bit sample depth wav files, but I am sure I will end up with many other uses for this. Also I would like to have somehthing that is much more than just a simple conversion tool, but rather a great all around command for working with wav files.

## Starting Goals

    * () have updated code for reading the state of a wav file based on what I have in samp\_create R0.
    * () have a way to extend functionality by using a custom file that defines logic to call for each sample index
    * () can convert from a wav source, or generate from code
