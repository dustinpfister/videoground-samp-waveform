# waver todo list

## () - R0 - generator, for_samp
    * (done) I will need a main js file with code for writing wav
    * (done) have a built in generator for sin wave tone
    * (done) with read wav script I would like a get\_wav\_samples method working    
    * (done) I should be able to give start and end sample index values when calling this get\_wav\_samples method

    * () I should have a get wav total samples method so I know what kind of values to given when calling get wav samples method
    * () get wav samples method should work with 8, 16, and 24 bit wav files both mono and stereo
    
    * () once I have read_wav worked out I will have a better idea of how to start the final form of generators
    
    * () for\_samp functions: I will want to start a collection of built in for\_samp functions
    * () a for\_samp function will take generated sample data, and create a standard final data
    * () renderers: start a collection of functions that will render the final output ( wav, int text, 1-bit js array, one or many files, whatever ) 
    * () have a built in generator function for reading wav file source
    * () have a built in for\_samp function for conversion to n bit sample depth
    * () have init and done functions
    * () have a custom plugin format for defining how waver will work
    * () start one plugin format that will create array data to use with my 1bit waveform
