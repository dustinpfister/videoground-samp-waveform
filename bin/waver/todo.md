# waver todo list

## () - R0 - generator, for_samp
    * (done) I will need a main js file with code for writing wav
    * (done) have a built in generator for sin wave tone
    
    * () finish what I worked out for read\_wav script
    * () once I have read_wav worked out I will have a better idea of how to start the final form of generators
    
    * () for\_samp functions: I will want to start a collection of built in for\_samp functions
    * () a for\_samp function will take generated sample data, and create a standard final data
    * () renderers: start a collection of functions that will render the final output ( wav, int text, 1-bit js array, one or many files, whatever ) 
    * () have a built in generator function for reading wav file source
    * () have a built in for\_samp function for conversion to n bit sample depth
    * () have init and done functions
    * () have a custom plugin format for defining how waver will work
    * () start one plugin format that will create array data to use with my 1bit waveform
