# wav_log

What I want to do with this project is have a way to log out sample data from a wav file in a number of formats. The first and formost reason I want to do this is to just have a basic tool for creating 1-bit sample depth data from 8, 16, and 24 bit sample depth wav files, but I am sure I will end up with many other uses for this.

## Starting Goals

    * have updated code for reading the state of a wav file.
