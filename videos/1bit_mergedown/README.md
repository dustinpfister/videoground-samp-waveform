# 1bit_mergedown

Another major idea that seems to keep coming back to me over and over again is to look more into how to go about doing some things with 1bit sound. Technically the end result will not really be 1bot sound mind you, but rather 1bit sample depth sound scaled up in the usual 16bit or 24bit sound that is needed to upload to Youtube. Getting more into that might be a matter for another video project folder though as all I want to do here is create a simple system in which I have more than one 1 bit track, and then I am creating a single final 1bit track by merging them down.

## Track Priority

The main thing here then is thinking in terms of track priority then. Sense it is not possible to mix because of the ultra low sample depth I have to think in terms of what sound is more important then another where there are timing conflicts. For example there is making the decision that a percussion track should take priory over a bass track.
