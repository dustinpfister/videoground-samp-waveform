# 1bit_music_rolls

Now that I have a music roll system in place that seems to work okay, I would now like to start working out some content where the focus is more so on the content itself rather than tools used to make content. This 1-bit music rolls project will then not just be content in which I test out my music roll system, but also a number of collections of music. Much of this music might end up being covers, but I might make a few original tunes as well.

## NES Covers ( video01-xx-* )

I think that maybe a good place to start with this will be a few Nintendo Entertainment System Covers \( NES Covers \). There was a lot of great music that came out with various games, and I think that it would be cool to hear some 1bit track to 16bit mix style music rolls of some key tunes from various games that came out with that system.
