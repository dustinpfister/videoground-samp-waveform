# 1bit_music_rolls

It is now time to start to make some real content using my bit\_tracks.js and music\_roll.js main js file projects rather than just the test content and experimental content that I have made up until this point. There is a not more I would like to do when it comes to additional work on the tools themselves, but I think that they might be working well enough for now that I can at least get started with this.
