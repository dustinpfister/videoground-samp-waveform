# nyquist_frequency todo list

## () - video02-01-sin-735-2spc
    * (done) using a sin waveform rather than pulse
    * (done) use samp debug to see what is going on with each sample    
    * () work more on R0 of samp debug adding functions to hep get more detail about the state for each sample
    * () see about using the a_update and int values for frequnecy to adress isshue realted to fractions of waveform cycles

## ( done 06/03/2024 ) - start video02-xx-sin, and drafts
    * (done) start video02-xx-sin set of videos using a sine waveform
    * (done) strat a drafts folder for this project that will contain video files that I will not be making vinal videos with
    * (done) rename video01-02, and video01-03 to drafts as I think that I have rushed things here

## ( done 06/01/2024 ) - video01-03-pulse-735-2spc-update-count
    * (done) video in which a fixed number of updates are used for spc over the course of the video
    * (done) the count of updates could be one per frame, or 4 per frame, ect
    * (done) starting at 735 spc (60 hertz)

## ( done 05/31/2024 ) video01-02-pulse-1k-2spc-noround
    * (done) same as video01-01 only no rounding
    * (done) should still have the samples per cycle fixed to a a given precision
    
## ( done 05/31/2024 ) video01-01-pulse-1k-2spc
    * (done) new pulse waveform function that works as exspected for high frequencys
    * (done) new display that shows the current state of each sample for each frame
    * (done) have a system for setting a start point for samples per cycle 
    * (done) update on a sample by sample basis, not frame
