# bass_basic

First video of this collection, and also the aim here is to work out a basic bass waveform. Nothing fancy with this, in fact it might even just be a hacked over form of a simple sin wave even if that will work. I am thinking that the very basics of a decent bass waveform might just be that, but the one little detail beyond that would be that the amplitude of the bass should go up and down over the course of duraction of a note.
