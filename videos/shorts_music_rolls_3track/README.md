# shorts_music_rolls_3track

The idea that I have here is to use my music roll format to create youtube shorts all of which are composed of three tracks, no more, no less. This allows for me to work more so on my music roll code, making any needed changes with the system in place. I can also come up with new waveform functions to be used for any one of the three tracks. Another nice thing about this is keeping the duration of the music rolls under one minute as music composition can prove to be time consuming.
