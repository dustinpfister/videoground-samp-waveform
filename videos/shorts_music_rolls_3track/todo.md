## () DRAFT: draft01-02-test-waveform-params
    * (done) I will want to have at least one track waveform that makes use of one or more waveform paramaters
    * (done) work on R1 of music rolls, and get waveform paramaters working
    * (done) work out a new draft roll that makes use of paramaters
    * (done) I should be able to use param names rather than p0, p1, ect
    
    * () get roll waveform params to work with all three tracks
    * () I shoukd be able to set fractions of a hert if I want to ( R1 fix )

    TRACK OBJECTS:
        * () I would like to try out having a main wrapper waveform that will process options that have to do with note alpha settings
