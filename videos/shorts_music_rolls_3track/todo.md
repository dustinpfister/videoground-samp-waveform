## () DRAFT: draft01-02-test-waveform-params
    TRACK OBJECTS:
        * () I will want to have at least one track waveform that makes use of one or more waveform paramaters
    MUSIC ROLLS:
        * () work on R1 of music rolls, and get waveform paramaters working
        * () work out a new roll that makes use of paramaters

## () DRAFT: draft01-03-wrapper-functions
    TRACK OBJECTS:
        * () I would like to try out having a main wrapper waveform that will process options that have to do with note alpha settings

    * (done) start a main mix waveform function
    * (done) I should have a points system for setting what the amplitude is for each track
    * (done) the samp objects for each track should be in the form of an array
    * (done) I will want to have the music roll as an external file
    * (done) I can start with the code from a video with my 1bit music rolls project that
    * (done) see about fixing whats wrong with lines when using the square waveform
    * (done) I should have a way to change the colors used for points or lines
