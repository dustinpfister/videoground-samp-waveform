    * (done) I can start with the code from a video with my 1bit music rolls project that

    <!-- sample geometry -->
    * (done) start a new display that involves creating a buffer geometry
    * (done) the buffer geometry can be composed of 1470 points for each frame sample
    * (done) I will need a function that will create this kind of geometry
    * (done) I will need a function that will update this kind of geometry
    * () see about uisng vertex colors
    
    <!-- track objects -->
    * () I will want to work out a new system for the objects that will be used for each track
    
    <!-- Main Mix waveform -->
    * (done) start a main mix waveform function
    * () the samp objects for each track should be in the form of an array
    
    <!-- track waveforms -->
    * () I think I might want to have a main wrapper waveform that will process options that have to do with note alpha settings
    * () I will want to have a collection of waveform options to use for each track
    
    <!-- music rolls -->
    * () I will want to have the music roll as an external file
