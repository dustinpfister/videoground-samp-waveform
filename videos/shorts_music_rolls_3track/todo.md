## () draft01-02-test-waveform-params
    TRACK OBJECTS:
        * () I will want to have at least one track waveform that makes use of one or more waveform paramaters
    MUSIC ROLLS:
        * () work on R1 of music rolls, and get waveform paramaters working
        * () work out a new roll that makes use of paramaters

## () draft01-02-wrapper-functions
    TRACK OBJECTS:
        * () I would like to try out having a main wrapper waveform that will process options that have to do with note alpha settings

## () draft01-01-test-core-idea
        * (done) start a new display that involves creating a buffer geometry
        * (done) the buffer geometry can be composed of 1470 points for each frame sample
        * (done) I will need a function that will create this kind of geometry
        * (done) I will need a function that will update this kind of geometry
        * (done) see about uisng vertex colors
        * (done) start a new main js file for this
        * (done) have default options for style, and other settings, have custom options in this draft
        * (done) I will want to work out a new system for the objects that will be used for each track
        * (done) I will want to have a collection of waveform options to use for each track beyond just sin starting with square
        * (done) start a main mix waveform function
        * (done) I should have a points system for setting what the amplitude is for each track
        * (done) the samp objects for each track should be in the form of an array
        * (done) I will want to have the music roll as an external file
        * (done) I can start with the code from a video with my 1bit music rolls project that
        * (done) see about fixing whats wrong with lines when using the square waveform
    SAMPLE GEOMETRY:
        * () I should have a way to change the colors used for points or lines
