# sfz_start

Apart from creating waveforms by way of pure functions I would also like to make some headway with other ways of creating waveforms including reading sample data from external files. There is working out a few projects where I just go ahead and read sample data in a wav file, but I should also look into what the standards are for this sort of thing also at least a little. With that said the aim with this project folder is to make at least some headway with the SFZ file format.

## sfz, sf2, and sf3

Do not confuse sfz with sf2 and sf3. The sfz format is a text format that is a little more kindred to what I am used to with text file formats as a web dev, while sf2 and sf3 are binary file formats.
