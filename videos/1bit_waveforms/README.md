# 1bit_waveform

I would like to make a number of videos that have to do with working out new 1bit waveform functions using R2+ of bit\_tracks in the main javaScript folder of this Repo. In other words a function that will be called for every sample index value for an over all video and the return value will be a 0, or 1 for the amplitude of the sample index.
