# 1bit_waveform todo list

## ( ) - video01-xx-test-bzcurve-1x
    * () a waveform where a 2d bezer curve can be used to adjust duty cycle

## ( ) - video01-04-test-pulse-2a-note
    * (done) a pulse waveform where two alpha values are given for setting duty cycle
    * (done) also have a a_note option that will adjust from zero to the full range of the duty cycle
    * (done) work out at least some kind of tune for this using new music roll project
    * (done) have high and low tracks
    * (done) I would like to use frequency and amplitude for samp array objects ( music finish r0 of Music_roll)

## ( done 05/02/2024 ) - video01-03-test-tailfader
    * (done) start a waveform where one part of a duty cycle is just like pulse, but then the final 'fades'
    * (done) the fade is zero parts of the cycle that go up over the course of the final duration part of the waveform cycle

## ( done 05/02/2024 ) - video01-02-test-seedpulse
    * (done) start a 'seedpulse' waveform that is a kind of hybrid of pulse and seeded random noise
    * (done) the waveform contains zero fill parts, pulse parts, and noise parts
    * (done) use new sample alpha features to break the video into three parts

## ( done 05/01/2024 ) - video01-01-test-array
    * (done) start an array 1-bit waveform
    * (done) more than one track for this
    * (done) test out random array data
    * (done) test out literal array data
