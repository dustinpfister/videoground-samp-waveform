# 1bit_waveform todo list

## ( done 05/02/2024 ) - video01-03-test-tailfader
    * (done) start a waveform where one part of a duty cycle is just like pulse, but then the final 'fades'
    * (done) the fade is zero parts of the cycle that go up over the course of the final duration part of the waveform cycle


## ( done 05/02/2024 ) - video01-02-test-seedpulse
    * (done) start a 'seedpulse' waveform that is a kind of hybrid of pulse and seeded random noise
    * (done) the waveform contains zero fill parts, pulse parts, and noise parts
    * (done) use new sample alpha features to break the video into three parts

## ( done 05/01/2024 ) - video01-01-test-array
    * (done) start an array 1-bit waveform
    * (done) more than one track for this
    * (done) test out random array data
    * (done) test out literal array data
