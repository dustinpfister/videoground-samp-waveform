    * (done) start the video file as a clean, basic start point based on video02-01-param-noise
    * (done) use the same geometry project for creating a line for the waveform
    * (done) start to develop the new code to use for the state of the breath in the video file for now
    * (done) have a main create state object for the breath
    * (done) have a main update method for the breath
    * (done) fugure out current breath state index in update method
    * (done) figure out current 'state alpha' in update method
    
    * () just use a pulse waveform function
    * () just do box breathing ( https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321805 )
