# breath_tone

In my beta world collection of content I started a project that was cenetred around the idea of controled breathing. When I made that project I worked out some javaScript code that can be used to configure what the values should be in terms of how many breath cycles as well as the amount of time for each in breath, hold and exhale. I used the code to govern vishual elements in the over all project, but then worked out the tones in audacity. Now that I know way more about how to go about generatig audio sample data with a little javaScript code I can now start a project in which I use such code to not just update aspects of vishual elements, but to also use the state of such a thing for the generation of audio as well.

The state of the code in the beta world project is a little messy, so I think that I will be starting over when it comes to this project.
