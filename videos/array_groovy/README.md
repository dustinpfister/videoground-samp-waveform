# array_groovy

What I wanted to do for this project is to create another array waveform, but this time using audio sample data exported from audacity as the array data. For this project I created an 8Kzh sample rate file of 4k samples sound based on a sound of Bruce Campbell saying the word 'groovy' from the film Army of Darkness.
