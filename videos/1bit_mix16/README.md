# 1bit_mix16

The general idea here is to have more than one 1-bit track, however when it comes to creating a 16-bit mix I am not merging down and then scaling up. Alliteratively I am scaling up to 16bit for each track, then sense I have 16bit tracks I can then mix as usual. As such this results in having more then one 1bit track that is played in parallel without having to prioritize one track over that of another. This might not be true 1-bit sound then, but nothing uploaded to YouTube truly is to begin with as sound must a minimum of at least 16bit sample depth.

## Goals for the project

Just as with any other idea here the goal is to just get started with a general idea of what I want to do. As of this writing I all ready have the core idea of what I want working, and now it is just a question of how many videos I want to make, and if this will result in some kind of long term project or not. Apart from just mixing upscaled 1bit sound tracks there are a lot of other things I might want to refine while working on this that have to do with custom waveform functions, and ways to store music tracks.
