# 1bit_mix16

The general idea here is to have more than one 1-bit track, however when it comes to creating a 16-bit mix I am not merging down and then scaling. Alliteratively I am scaling up to 16bit for each track, then sense I have 16bit tracks I can then mix as usual. As such this results in having more then one 1bit track that is played in parallel without having to prioritize one track over that of another. This might not be true 1-bit sound then, but nothing uploaded to Youtube truly is to begin with as 1-bit sound must at a minimum be upscaled to at least 16bit sample depth.
