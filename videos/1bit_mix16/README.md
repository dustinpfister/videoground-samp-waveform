# 1bit_mix16

The general idea here is to have more than one 1bit track, however when it comes to creating a 16bit mix I am not merging down and then scaling. Alliteratively I am scaling up to 16bit for each track, then sense I have 16bit tracks I can then mix as usual. As such this results in having more then one 1bit track that is played in parallel.
