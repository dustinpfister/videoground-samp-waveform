# 1bit_mix16 todo list

## () - video01-08-test-music-objects
* () start a new main js module called 'music\_objects' and start R0 of the module
* () start with what I all ready have worked out in video01-06-note-alpha
* () this video will be the first test video when working on this

## () - video01-07-test-custom-waveform
* () I will want to have the option to give a custom 1-bit waveform function to use

## () - video01-06-test-note-alpha
* (done) just work out a simple demo of note alphas
* (done) use these note alphas to set pitch on sample by sample rate, and use plain old awave value
* (done) more refined methods in line with the task of creating more than one song object
* () work out note alphas, and use it to adjust pitch for each note
* () work out two tracks for this

## ( done 04/22/2024 ) - video01-05-test-pitch
* (done) I would like to demo another use of the 'tone' mode
* (done) This can also be a test of sample by sample change of frequency

## ( done 04/22/2024 ) - video01-04-test-awave
* (done) use 'tone' mode and adjust the freqency used over time
* (done) test out new optional a_wave method when using Bit_tracks.for_sampset
* (done) there seems to be a problem here when setting frequency, look into it
* (done) I would like to have better debug tools that will write out plain text sample data as many files
* (done) frequnecy looks good, sample data also, but I need an expression that will work well for the awave value used
* (done) For this video at least I think I will just demo an awave value, and maybe look into this more as another project

## ( done 04/18/2023 ) - video01-03-test-noise
* (done) see about starting a noise waveform function for R1 of bit tracks
* (done) have a three track tune for lows, highs, and noise
* (done) track objects in R1 of bit\_tracks.js
* (done) modes for setting how to get the current state of freq for a waveform
* (done) work out a final tune for this video

## ( done 04/15/2024 ) - video01-02-test-notehelper
* (done) new note format for making a song
* (done) note helper funcitons in new r1 version of bit_tracks js file
* (done) new tune 

## ( done 04/09/2023 ) - video01-01-test-2tracks - core idea working
* (done) core idea working
* (done) mixing two 1 bit tracks
