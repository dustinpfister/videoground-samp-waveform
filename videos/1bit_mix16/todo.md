## () - video01-05-test-note-alphas
* () work out some helper functions for parsing new 'song' system

## () - video01-04-test-awave
* (done) use 'tone' mode and adjust the freqency used over time
* (done) test out new optional a_wave method when using Bit_tracks.for_sampset
* (done) there seems to be a problem here when setting frequency, look into it
* (done) I would like to have better debug tools that will write out plain text sample data as many files
* (done) frequnecy looks good, sample data also, but I need an expression that will work well for the awave value used
* () For this video at least I think I will just think more in terms of 60 hertz to 6 kHz, any maybe look into this more as another project

* (done) have a three track tune for lows, highs, and noise
* (done) track objects in R1 of bit\_tracks.js
* (done) modes for setting how to get the current state of freq for a waveform
* (done) work out a final tune for this video
