# samp-create.js

After starting a few projects that have to do with generating audio sample data, I have found that I should start a main js file rather than copying files and hacking over things on a project by project basis. This will then be the start of a project that will be a fixed set of code that I will link to in a set of project folders. This project started with the same code that I worked out in my videoground-beta-world colleciton of content, and sense then I have plans at least when it comes to addtional revisions for this now that I have a whole other collection here where the main focus is just sound alone and not much of anything else.

## The samp_create.js file

The samp_create.js file is the main file of interest that is used to create an array of raw sample data using a built in wavefrom, or one of the many additional waveforms to choose from in the waveforms folder.

## The samp_tools.js file

A number of tools that have help with various typical tasks such as setting a frequnecy.

## The samp_draw.js file

The name should say it all this is what I am using to draw what the current state of sound is on a frame by frame basis.
