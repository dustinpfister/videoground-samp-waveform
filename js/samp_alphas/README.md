# samp_alphas

There are a number of methods that help with alpha values in the samp\_tools.js file that I have as one of several files for samp\_create. However I think that the name of that file is to vague, and I have the alpha methods grouped together with all kinds of other features. So I am thinking that I should in time retire the samp\_tools files in favor of several files that are less vague as to what they do, and this samp\_alphas file aims to be one of those. 

## What is an Alpha Value?

Simply put a number in the range of 0 to 1, a subject that comes up often in programming. There are many names for this kind of value actually, I have just come to call them alpha values. This file is then a collection of methods to help create these kinds of values in differing ways, and is geared more in the direction of doing so with sample index values, but in theory could be used outside of this kind of coding also.
