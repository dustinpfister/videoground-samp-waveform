# music_roll todo list

## () - R0 - Just get the core idea of this working
    * (done) work out what the format will be for setting just pitch and amplitude
    * (done) start code that will parse the text into objects
    * (done) I will need a helper function to process counts to help with the note alphas
    * (done) I will want a playback function that will take an array of objects, and an alpha value
    * (done) playback function should return an array of objects to help set the samp values of the waveform function used
    
    * () frequency, and amplitude should be used in place of freq, and amp if that is the overall standard here 
    * () set total seconds helper that takes an objects array, and lines_per_minute argument to get total seconds
    * () parse paramaters, yes?
    * () more than one standard for setting frequnecy allowing for plain number values
    * () update readme with hello world examples, any needed details
