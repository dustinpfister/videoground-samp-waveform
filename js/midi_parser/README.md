# midi-parser

This is a custom hackjob of midi-parser by colxi ( https://github.com/colxi/midi-parser-js/ ), as of this writing I just removed code that has to do with parsing base64 strings, and other formats other than a Uint8Array which is all I am to use for this. The main goal here is to have a tool to help in the process of converting midi to the plain text format that I use for my music roll project. I might want that to be a whole other project though so as long as this works good enough it might be a done deal.
