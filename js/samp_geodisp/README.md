# samp_geodisp

I have started out with a simple 2d display for showing the state of a collection of audio sample data that is part of the main samp create project. However I think that it would be a good idea to retire the use of that in favor of one or more alternatives for this sort of thing. When it comes to this samp\_geodisp project the general idea that I have is to just start using THREE.BufferGeometry objects as a way to display the current state of some audio sample data. This can be as simple as just creating a geometry that just has a position attribute, and use that with THREE.Points, or a far more complex geometry with many attributes used with THREE.Mesh and custom materials. For starters at least though there is just going with points, and that alone might work well.
