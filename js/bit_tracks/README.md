# bit_tracks project

This is a javascript file that I started for my 1bit\_mix16 project, but now think that it would be best to make this a main js folder project as I would like to reuse this code accross many other 1bit projects rather than just the mix16 project.

## Current goals for bit_tracks.js

As of this writing I am currently working on R1 of the project where I am trying to work out some core problems that will need to be adressed. As I keep working on this project I should take a moment now and then to update this readme file when I have a more solid project to write about to begin with.
